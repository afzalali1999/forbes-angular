## About

This project was part of my interview with Forbes. I attempted to clone, redesign, and add a new user-generated blog feature to the (cloned) Forbes website to attract and retain more users. This feature kind of mimics Medium's blog posts. I believe that this feature will help bring more users to the Forbes website because the blog content will be generated/created by the community. If this happens, then Forbes can use a recommender system to rank the best blog posts and email recommendations to users. This is powerful as many of the top tech companies today leverage recommender systems to attract and retain users. In addition, the content will be dynamically generated and always keep the user interested, instead of the static website that Forbes displays.

## The Design

I attempted to redesign the blog content by adding a card or shadow css effect behind every blog post. Doing so actually brings comfort to the user's eye and reduces the sharpness of the edge of each picture/blog posts. Another alternative design that I would have made here is to remove the card/shadow effect and just add a border radius to the images of the blog posts. An image with a rounded border against a white background gives more ease to the user's eye than a sharp corner. An example of this design being implemented can be seen on [airbnb's homepage](https://www.airbnb.com/) and [pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/).

## Masonry Layout

Another aspect of design that I've implemented in this project is the masonry layout. This layout is inspired by [pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/) and is actually the correct design layout for the user-generated blog feature. Because the blog content is being shown dynamically, masonry grid layout is the best design to keep a user on the site for a longer peroid of time. New content is constantly being shown to the user through the use of Masonry Layout which keeps them hooked onto the platform.

## Mobile Responsive

This app is fully mobile responsive and correctly resizes on large desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices.
